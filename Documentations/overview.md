# Video Streaming System Documentation

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Summary**:  
This project involves developing a basic video streaming system. The system captures video using a laptop camera, encodes it, streams it via a media server, and plays it on a client device. The initial implementation will use standard components with minimal configuration.

## 2. Component Setup

**Video Capture & Encoding**:

- **Hardware**: Laptop camera (standard built-in camera).
- **Configuration**: Minimal configuration required; defaults can be used for initial testing.

**Streaming Server**:

- **Software**: To be determined (e.g., Nginx with RTMP module or similar media server).
- **Installation**: Follow standard installation procedures for the chosen media server. Configuration will be minimal for the initial setup.

**Video Player**:

- **Player Choice**: Standard video player (e.g., HTML5 video player or similar).
- **Integration**: Connect the player to the streaming server using standard protocols.

## 3. Implementation Details

- **Code**: To be developed; code repository will be created as development progresses.
- **Setup Scripts**: To be developed; initial setup will involve manual configuration, with scripts to be created for automation in the future.

## 4. Testing

- **Testing Procedures**:

  - **Capture & Encode**: Verify video capture from the laptop camera and check encoding quality.
  - **Streaming**: Ensure that the video is correctly streamed from the server to the client.
  - **Playback**: Test video playback on various devices to ensure compatibility and performance.

- **Results**:
  - Initial tests will focus on ensuring that video capture, encoding, and streaming are functioning correctly. Any issues identified during testing will be documented and addressed.

## 5. Usage

- **How to Use**:

  - **Start the Camera**: Open the camera application on the laptop and ensure it is functioning.
  - **Run the Streaming Server**: Start the media server software and configure it to receive video from the camera.
  - **Play Video**: Open the video player and connect it to the streaming server to view the video.

- **Troubleshooting**:
  - **No Video**: Check camera connections and ensure the streaming server is running.
  - **Playback Issues**: Verify video player compatibility and check server logs for errors.

## 6. Future Enhancements

- **Planned Features**: To be determined.
- **Notes**: Additional features and optimizations will be considered and added as the project progresses.
